;;; Commentary:

;; Puni is a package for structured editing.  Its main features are:

;; - A set of customizable soft deletion commands, enabled by `puni-mode'.
;;   Soft deletion means deleting while keeping expressions balanced.
;; - A simple API `puni-soft-delete-by-move', for defining your own soft
;;   deletion commands.
;; - Sexp navigating and manipulating commands.
;; - Completely based on Emacs built-in mechanisms, doesn't contain any
;;   language-specific logic, yet work on many major modes.

;; It's recommended to use Puni with `electric-pair-mode'.  Read README.md to
;; know more about Puni.  If you haven't received such a file, please visit
;; https://github.com/AmaiKinono/puni.
